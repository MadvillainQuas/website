-- ============================================================================
-- Fix: recompute_standings threw "function max(boolean) does not exist".
--
-- The streak calculation used max() over a boolean, which Postgres has no
-- aggregate for, and the error only surfaced when the function was CALLED —
-- plpgsql bodies are not fully type-checked at creation time.
--
-- Rewritten with a clearer formulation: find each team's most recent result,
-- find the first game that differs, and the streak is everything before it.
